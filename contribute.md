by [@Andrew](https://github.com/aj-medianet), [@Rustin](https://github.com/rustinwinger) and [@Robert](https://github.com/pfingstr)
and we'll do our best to help you get started. This page will give you a quick
overview of how things are organised and most importantly, how to get involved.

## Issues and bug reports

First, [do a quick search](https://github.com/aj-medianet/snowdata.org/issues)
to see if the issue has already been reported. If so, it's often better to just
leave a comment on an existing issue.

### Submitting issues

When opening an issue, use a **descriptive title** and include your
**environment**. 

-   **Describing your issue:** Try to provide as many details as possible. What
    exactly goes wrong? _How_ is it failing? Is there an error?
    "XY doesn't work" usually isn't that helpful for tracking down problems.

-   **Sharing long blocks of code or logs:** If you need to include long code,
    logs or tracebacks, you can wrap them in `<details>` and `</details>`. This
    [collapses the content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details)
    so it only becomes visible on click, making the issue easier to read and follow.

### Getting started

To make changes to SnowData's code base, you need to fork then clone the GitHub repository and build SnowData from source. Follow the guide in [README.md](README.md)

### Contributor agreement

### Fixing bugs

When fixing a bug, first create an
[issue](https://github.com/aj-medianet/snowdata.org/issues) if one does not already exist.
The description text can be very short â€“ we don't want to make this too
bureaucratic.
