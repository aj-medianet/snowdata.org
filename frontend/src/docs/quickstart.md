### Introduction
***

SnowData provides an easy to use API to access current snow data scraped directly from ski areas. You can access current data as well as monthly data generated thoughout the season. 

The API gives up to date new snowfall, year to date snowfall, snow depth, wind speed, wind direction and current temperatures. You can also look at historical data that we've collected.

Our API is free to use; however, we will be looking into paid models in the future depending on interest.
